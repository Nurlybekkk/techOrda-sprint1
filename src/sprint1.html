        <h2>Khabib defeated Connor and broke the chain</h2>
        <p>Las Vegas hosted the main fight not only this year, but also, as many people say, the main fight in the history of the UFC. Khabib Nurmagomedov and Conor McGregor fought for the UFC lightweight title. The victory was won by a suffocating reception in the fourth round by a Russian, but the fight ended in a giant scandal.</p>
        <p>Thrashing before significant fights is a phenomenon so familiar that you treat it with a smile. Well, the guys are warming up their interest in the fight, well done, they will earn more money themselves. Most often, they don't allow themselves anything too personal, and if they do, they hug after the final fight, showing that it was all a game.</p>
        <p>In the case of Nurmagomedov and McGregor, everything is different. Here the guys have crossed all the boundaries. More precisely, one of the guys. McGregor insulted Abdulmanap, Khabib's father, at a press conference, which is clearly too much for a Caucasian. When the family is touched, they do not forgive.</p>
